### Project Overview:

This project consists of multiple JavaScript functions and ScrollReveal animations to enhance user experience. Let's delve into each function's purpose:

#### Navbar Close:

- **navbarMenu()**: This function controls the behavior of the navbar menu. When a navigation item is clicked, it closes the navbar if it's open. Additionally, clicking the navbar image toggles the visibility of the navbar menu.

#### Help Center:

- **initHelpButton()**: Initializes the help button functionality. When clicked, it reveals the help center form. The form can be closed by clicking the close button.

#### Read More Button:

- **toggleReadMore()**: Toggles the visibility of additional content when the "Read More" button is clicked. If the content is hidden, the button changes to "Show Less" to allow users to collapse the content.

#### ScrollReveal Animations:

Several ScrollReveal animations are applied throughout the website to create engaging visual effects:

- Text elements, images, and other content are revealed with smooth animations as users scroll down the page.

#### Swiper Sliders:

Multiple Swiper sliders are implemented to showcase different sections of the website:

- **Slider 1**: Displays images with navigation buttons for user interaction.
- **Slider 2**: Offers a carousel of images with responsive breakpoints for various screen sizes.
- **Slider 3**: Presents a slideshow of images with autoplay functionality and navigation arrows.
- **Slider 4**: Features testimonials with navigation arrows for easy browsing.

### Important Note:
